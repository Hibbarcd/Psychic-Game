# Psychic-Game
This is a simple game where the user presses keys in an attempt to guess a randomly chosen letter.  You get 10 guesses, and will be alerted whether you get the letter correct, or run out of guesses. Wins/Losses will be tracked.

This was created as a project for the University of MN Full Stack Coding BootCamp program.
